                <h2>Hi I'm Doris Anumba and this is my Tech Journey....</h2>

                <p>Welcome to my tech journey! In this simple website I am gonna tell you a lil bit about my tech
                        journey.</p>
                    <p>Honestly,I have always been the kind of person who loves trying new things, learning new skills,
                        and pushing myself out of the usual box. So when I decided to get into tech, I sat down and
                        asked myself
                        <p class="italics"> What part of tech actually fits me? </p>
                        <p>At first, I thought maybe I’d go into design. I mean, I can use tools and make
                        designs? Not really my thing even though I know my way around Canva.But the idea of building
                        apps, games, or websites? That vibe pulled me in heavy.
                        So I started exploring. At one point, I even took a course on the Internet of Things (IoT),Typical me
                        just trying to figure out where I truly belonged. It was interesting, but still didn’t feel like
                        “me.” That’s how I slowly started leaning toward coding.</p>
                    </p>At first, I wasn’t even sure which direction to take, frontend or backend and honestly? I’m
                    still figuring that part out. But I’m in it for the long haul.
                    Last year, I tried backend through a Zuri Training program.I was ready... then life said, “Hold
                    up.” NYSC camp came around, and I lost three whole weeks. After camp, everything got hectic
                    settling into a PPA, figuring out life again and just like that, the momentum was gone. I didn’t
                    finish. I barely scratched the surface.
                    But I didn’t let that stop me.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward to this year — post-service, post-chaos — I picked up
                    where I left off. I started teaching myself through YouTube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia">TraversyMedia</a> and a site called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. It was clicking. It
                    was working.</p>
                    <p>Now, I’m here with UpSkill by <a href="https://www.genesystechhub.com/">Genesys</a> , and it feels like a real step forward. It hasn’t been
                    easy.Coming from a medical background, everything feels brand new. The tasks stretch me. Sometimes I
                    feel stuck. But I actually love the challenge.</p>
                    <p>And even though I’m still learning, I’m proud of how far I’ve come.God willing, I’ll complete this
                    program, move up into Learnable, and become a developer that can build beautiful, useful things
                    whether that’s websites, apps, or something even bigger.</p>
                    Thanks for reading my story and this is just the beginning.
                    <p>Well That’s a wrap on my tech journey so far, and I’d like to hear about yours!</p>
